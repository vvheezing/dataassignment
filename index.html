<p>
The Bangladeshi immigrant population is one of the fastest-growing in all of New York City. While they are a signigicant portion of the city, there are many roadblocks facing the commmunity, especially its women. 
</p>

<p>
Due to a lack of resources, Bangladeshi women have an increased rate of poverty, abuse, and mental health issues. Thankfully, there are some organizations working to help these women and empower them through learning and assistance. Organizations like Sapna NYC do this through various forms of classes and training to assist new arrivals in navigating their new environment.

<p> One of the most popular and impactful resources that women can take advantage of is English literacy courses. Many Bangladeshi women come to New York City with little to no knowledge of the English language, making it difficult to communicate to others outside of their community. Free English speaking and writing classes allow women to be more independent in their new environment.

Family counseling is offered to all members of a household. Often it is difficult to find affordable counseling that is proficient for all ages in life. The language barrier can make finding the right help especially difficult for immigrant women. This resource can not only assist with issues in the home, but also make the transition to New York City much smoother.

Another important class offered is computer literacy classes. Taking classes like these can help immigrant women become more independent-- proficiency in computers can help in a job search as well as helping with the ability to find resources they may need at any time.

    One of the most important facets of life is health. Sapna works to provide holistic care for all women who reach out to them. This includes mental health, emotional health, and physical health. To help with this, they offer mental health counseling, financial counseling, and fitness classes in hopes of facilitating a happy and healthy community.
